This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:INVALID_FORMAT\nexplanation:INVALID_FORMAT<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nProvide your response only in this format:\nguess:word\nexplanation:details.\nPlease try again<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:starting with a common five-letter English word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tease\nexplanation:since the letter \"e\" is in the correct position, I'm keeping it in the same place.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> e<red> a<red> s<red> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:lease\nexplanation:the letter \"e\" is still in the correct position, so I'm keeping it there.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> e<red> a<red> s<red> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:gleam\nexplanation:since the letter \"e\" is in the correct position, I'm keeping it there.
