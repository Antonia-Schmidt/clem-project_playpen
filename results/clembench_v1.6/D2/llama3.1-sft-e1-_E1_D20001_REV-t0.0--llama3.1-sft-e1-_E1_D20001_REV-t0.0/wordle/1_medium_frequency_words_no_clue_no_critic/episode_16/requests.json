You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since 'a' is in the word but not in the correct position, and 'p', 'l', and 'e' are not in the word, I will try 'table' as my next guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:crate\nexplanation:Since 't' and 'a' are in the word but not in the correct position, and 'b', 'l', and 'e' are not in the word, I will try 'crate' as my next guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<green> t<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:brack\nexplanation:Since 'r' is in the word but not in the correct position, and 'a' is in the correct position, and 'c', 'e', and 't' are not in the word, I will try 'brack' as my next guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<yellow> a<green> c<red> k<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:arise\nexplanation:Since 'r' is in the word but not in the correct position, and 'a' is in the correct position, and 'b', 'c', 'k', and 'e' are not in the word, I will try 'arise' as my next guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> r<yellow> i<red> s<green> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
