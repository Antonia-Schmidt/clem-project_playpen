You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:cloud\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" are red, I am guessing a new word that starts with \"c\" and has the letters \"l\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"d\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<red> o<green> u<green> d<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:Since \"o\" and \"u\" are green, I am guessing a new word that includes these letters and excludes \"c\", \"l\", and \"d\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<yellow> u<yellow> s<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:mouse\nexplanation:Since \"o\" and \"u\" are yellow, I am guessing a new word that includes these letters and excludes \"h\", \"s\", and \"e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: m<red> o<yellow> u<yellow> s<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:mouse\nexplanation:Since \"o\" and \"u\" are yellow, I am guessing a new word that includes these letters and excludes \"m\", \"s\", and \"e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: m<red> o<yellow> u<yellow> s<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
