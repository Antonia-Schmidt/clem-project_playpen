This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:cloud\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word that fits the given criteria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<red> o<red> u<red> d<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:In the previous guess, all the letters were marked as red, indicating that they are not present in the target word.
