You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:05:34.900469", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: cloud\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word that fits the given criteria."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:05:34.900475", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "cloud", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word that fits the given criteria."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:05:34.900509", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = gloat\nguess: cloud\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<green> o<green> u<red> d<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "gloat", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D20003_REV)", "guess": "cloud", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word that fits the given criteria.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:05:40.302858", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> l<green> o<green> u<red> d<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:05:40.302898", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:lofty\nexplanation:In the guess_feedback, the letter \"l\" is green, indicating that it is in the correct position in the target word.
