This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:06:48.270731", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: cloud\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word that fits the given criteria."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:06:48.270736", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "cloud", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word that fits the given criteria."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:06:48.270769", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = unfed\nguess: cloud\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<red> o<red> u<yellow> d<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unfed", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D20003_REV)", "guess": "cloud", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word that fits the given criteria.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:06:52.966108", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> l<red> o<red> u<yellow> d<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:06:52.966147", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:loud\nexplanation:In the previous guess, \"u\" was yellow, indicating that it is in the target word but not in the correct position.
