You don't need to describe the empty squares, which are denoted with \"▢\". Only describe the location of letters in the grid. Then you wait for me to say \"What is your next instruction?\", and then you continue with the next step. Take the size of the grid into consideration while giving instructions. When you have described everything, you say \"DONE\".\n\nFor the filled grid above, here are the example steps.\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: Put an E in second row third column\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: Fill the last row with X\n\nWhat is your next instruction?\nInstruction: DONE\n\nOk. Please do this for the following example, which is a 5 by 5 grid.\n▢ ▢ N ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nN ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\nN ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢\n▢ ▢ ▢ N N\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in first row second column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in second row second column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in third row first column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in third row second column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in third row third column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in third row fourth column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in third row fifth column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fourth row first column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fourth row second column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fourth row third column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fourth row fourth column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fourth row fifth column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fifth row fifth column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fifth row fourth column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fifth row third column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fifth row second column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: Put an N in fifth row first column.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nWhat is your next instruction?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nInstruction: DONE<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2024-11-24 05:21:15.908635", "call_duration": "0:00:00.293098", "response": "Instruction: DONE", "model_name": "llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D20003_REV"}}}]
