        <p>CLUE: One popular way to perform the target action is by using the palm of the hand. This involves extending the hand with the palm facing upwards, and then bringing the hand down to make contact with the other person or object. Another way to perform the action is by using the fingers. This involves extending the hand with the fingers spread apart, and then bringing the hand down to make contact with the other person or object.</p>

For example, when performing the action in a formal or professional setting, it is often best to use the palm of the hand.
