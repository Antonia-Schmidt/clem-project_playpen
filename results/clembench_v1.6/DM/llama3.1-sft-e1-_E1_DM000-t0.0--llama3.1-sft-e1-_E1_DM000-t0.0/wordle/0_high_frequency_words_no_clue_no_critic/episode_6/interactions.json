You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-16T12:08:59.412398", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nNow, please provide the feedback for \"apple\" so I can use it to determine my next guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-16T12:08:59.412403", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-16T12:08:59.412437", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = field\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "field", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_DM000)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-16T12:09:17.013864", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-16T12:09:17.013942", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "Now that I have the feedback, I can use it to determine my next guess.
