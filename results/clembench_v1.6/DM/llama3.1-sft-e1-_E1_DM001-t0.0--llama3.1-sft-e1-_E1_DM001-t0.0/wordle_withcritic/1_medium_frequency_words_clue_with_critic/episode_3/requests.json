You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:hospital supply<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:nurse\nexplanation:Nurses are a common sight in hospitals, and the word \"nurse\" has 5 letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:hospital supply\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the clue mentions \"hospital supply\", which suggests a focus on equipment or materials, rather than personnel like nurses.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:hospital supply\nguess:bandage\nexplanation:Bandages are a common supply in hospitals, and the word \"bandage\" has 7 letters, but I can shorten it to 5 letters as \"banda\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters.
