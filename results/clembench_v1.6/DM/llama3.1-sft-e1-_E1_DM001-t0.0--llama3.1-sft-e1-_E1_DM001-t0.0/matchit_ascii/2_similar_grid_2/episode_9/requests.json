There are 4 X's in the grid, and the rest of the squares are empty (▢). The X's are arranged in a square pattern in the middle of the grid.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nThis is my DESCRIPTION: The grid is a 5x5 square. The top and bottom rows have Xs in the middle three columns. The second and fourth rows have Xs in the middle two columns. The middle row is filled with Xs.\nQUESTION: Are there any Xs in the first or last column of your grid?
