You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:bravado\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:42.032351", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: talky\nexplanation: Bravado is a term often used to describe boastful or empty talk, so I chose \"talky\" as it captures this idea and is a five-letter word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:42.032356", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "talky", "explanation": "Bravado is a term often used to describe boastful or empty talk, so I chose \"talky\" as it captures this idea and is a five-letter word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:42.032391", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = swash\ntarget_word_clue = bravado\nguess: talky\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> l<red> k<red> y<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30003_REV)", "guess": "talky", "explanation": "Bravado is a term often used to describe boastful or empty talk, so I chose \"talky\" as it captures this idea and is a five-letter word.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "bravado"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:44.493729", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> l<red> k<red> y<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:44.493770", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:boast\nexplanation:Given the feedback, the letter 'a' is in the word but not in the second position. \"Boast\" is a synonym for bravado and fits the five-letter requirement."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:44.493774", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "boast", "explanation": "Given the feedback, the letter 'a' is in the word but not in the second position. \"Boast\" is a synonym for bravado and fits the five-letter requirement."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:44.493809", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = swash\ntarget_word_clue = bravado\nguess: boast\nguess_feedback: b<red> o<red> a<green> s<yellow> t<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30003_REV)", "guess": "boast", "explanation": "Given the feedback, the letter 'a' is in the word but not in the second position. \"Boast\" is a synonym for bravado and fits the five-letter requirement.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "bravado"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:47.643746", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> o<red> a<green> s<yellow> t<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:47.643789", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:arrog\nexplanation:With the feedback, we know 'a' is in the correct position and's' is in the word but not in the fourth position. \"Arrog\" is a word that fits the clue \"bravado\" and the letter pattern."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:47.643794", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "arrog", "explanation": "With the feedback, we know 'a' is in the correct position and's' is in the word but not in the fourth position. \"Arrog\" is a word that fits the clue \"bravado\" and the letter pattern."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:47.643809", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD while parsing Player 1's (model: llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30003_REV) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30003_REV)", "guess": "arrog", "explanation": "With the feedback, we know 'a' is in the correct position and's' is in the word but not in the fourth position. \"Arrog\" is a word that fits the clue \"bravado\" and the letter pattern.", "error": "NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD", "target_word_clue": "bravado"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:53:50.791932", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "your guess is not a valid word for this game.
