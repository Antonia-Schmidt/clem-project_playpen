You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:31:39.133760", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: crane\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word to cover a wide range of common vowels and consonants."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:31:39.133765", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word to cover a wide range of common vowels and consonants."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:31:39.133826", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = unfed\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "unfed", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30003_REV)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word to cover a wide range of common vowels and consonants.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:31:43.535900", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:31:43.535941", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:token\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letters 'n' and 'e' are in the word but not in the positions guessed previously.
