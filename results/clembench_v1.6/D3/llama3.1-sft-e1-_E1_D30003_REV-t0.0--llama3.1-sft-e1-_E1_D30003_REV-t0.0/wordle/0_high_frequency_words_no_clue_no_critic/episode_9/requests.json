This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:crane\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word to cover a wide range of common vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<green> n<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letter 'a' is in the correct position.
