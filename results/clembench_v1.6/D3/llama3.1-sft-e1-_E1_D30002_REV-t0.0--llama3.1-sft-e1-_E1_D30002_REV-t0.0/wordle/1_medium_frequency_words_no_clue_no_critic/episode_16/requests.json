This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since 'a' is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'a' in a different position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tales\nexplanation:Since 't' and 'a' are correct but in the wrong positions, I will try a word with 't' and 'a' in different positions and 'l' and 'e' in the correct positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> l<red> e<red> s<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:stare\nexplanation:Since 't' and 'a' are correct but in the wrong positions, and's' is correct in the last position, I will try a word with 't' and 'a' in different positions,'s' in the last position, and 'r' and 'e' in the middle.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<yellow> t<yellow> a<green> r<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:star\nexplanation:Since 'a' is in the correct position,'s' and 't' are correct but in the wrong positions, and 'r' is correct but in the wrong position, I will try a word with 'a' in the first position,'s' and 't' in different positions, 'r' in the last position, and 'o' in the middle.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters.
