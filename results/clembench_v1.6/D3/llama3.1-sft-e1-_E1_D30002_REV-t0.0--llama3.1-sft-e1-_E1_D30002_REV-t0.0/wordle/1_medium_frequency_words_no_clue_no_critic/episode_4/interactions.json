This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:32.992500", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:32.992504", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:32.992536", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = nerdy\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "nerdy", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30002_REV)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:35.132039", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:35.132079", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:stone\nexplanation:Since 'e' is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'e' in a different position."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:35.132083", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "stone", "explanation": "Since 'e' is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'e' in a different position."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:35.132118", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = nerdy\nguess: stone\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> o<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "nerdy", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30002_REV)", "guess": "stone", "explanation": "Since 'e' is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'e' in a different position.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:37.588725", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> t<red> o<red> n<yellow> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:13:37.588766", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:neigh\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, 'n' and 'e' are correct but in the wrong positions.
