You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:bravado\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:39.684933", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: talky\nexplanation: The word \"bravado\" can be associated with boastful talk, which could be described as \"talky.\" The feedback will help determine if any of the letters are in the correct position."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:39.684938", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "talky", "explanation": "The word \"bravado\" can be associated with boastful talk, which could be described as \"talky.\" The feedback will help determine if any of the letters are in the correct position."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:39.684975", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = swash\ntarget_word_clue = bravado\nguess: talky\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> l<red> k<red> y<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30002_REV)", "guess": "talky", "explanation": "The word \"bravado\" can be associated with boastful talk, which could be described as \"talky.\" The feedback will help determine if any of the letters are in the correct position.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "bravado"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:43.862297", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> l<red> k<red> y<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:43.862338", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:blare\nexplanation:Since the feedback indicates that the letter \"a\" is correct but in the wrong position, I will try another word with \"a\" in a different position. \"Blare\" is a word that can be associated with loud talk or boastful behavior, and it has the letter \"a\" in a different position than the previous guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:43.862342", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "blare", "explanation": "Since the feedback indicates that the letter \"a\" is correct but in the wrong position, I will try another word with \"a\" in a different position. \"Blare\" is a word that can be associated with loud talk or boastful behavior, and it has the letter \"a\" in a different position than the previous guess."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:43.862376", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = swash\ntarget_word_clue = bravado\nguess: blare\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<red> a<green> r<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "swash", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30002_REV)", "guess": "blare", "explanation": "Since the feedback indicates that the letter \"a\" is correct but in the wrong position, I will try another word with \"a\" in a different position. \"Blare\" is a word that can be associated with loud talk or boastful behavior, and it has the letter \"a\" in a different position than the previous guess.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "bravado"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:47.658915", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> l<red> a<green> r<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-24T00:43:47.658954", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:adieu\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letter \"a\" is in the correct position.
