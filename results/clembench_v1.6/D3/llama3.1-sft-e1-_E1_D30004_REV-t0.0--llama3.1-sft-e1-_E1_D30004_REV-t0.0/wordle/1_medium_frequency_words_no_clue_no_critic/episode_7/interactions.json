You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:43.599790", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:43.599796", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:43.599829", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = newly\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "newly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30004_REV)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:46.708732", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:46.708793", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:hello\nexplanation:Since 'l' is in the correct position and 'e' is in the word but not in the correct position, I will try the word \"hello\" which has 'l' in the correct position and 'e' in a different position."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:46.708798", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "hello", "explanation": "Since 'l' is in the correct position and 'e' is in the word but not in the correct position, I will try the word \"hello\" which has 'l' in the correct position and 'e' in a different position."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:46.708851", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = newly\nguess: hello\nguess_feedback: h<red> e<green> l<red> l<green> o<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "newly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D30004_REV)", "guess": "hello", "explanation": "Since 'l' is in the correct position and 'e' is in the word but not in the correct position, I will try the word \"hello\" which has 'l' in the correct position and 'e' in a different position.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:49.288979", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> e<green> l<red> l<green> o<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T22:38:49.289018", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:well\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, 'e' and 'l' are in the correct positions.
