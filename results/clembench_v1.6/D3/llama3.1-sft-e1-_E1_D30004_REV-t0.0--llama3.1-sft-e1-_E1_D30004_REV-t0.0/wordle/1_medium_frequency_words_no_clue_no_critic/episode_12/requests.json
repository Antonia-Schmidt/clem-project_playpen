This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:stone\nexplanation:Since 'e' is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'e' in a different position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<red> o<red> n<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:creed\nexplanation:Since 'e' is still the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'e' in a different position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> e<green> e<red> d<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:breed\nexplanation:Since 'r' is a correct letter but in the wrong position and 'e' is in the correct position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'r' in a different position and 'e' in the correct position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> r<yellow> e<green> e<red> d<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:greece\nexplanation:Since 'r' is a correct letter but in the wrong position and 'e' is in the correct position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'r' in a different position and 'e' in the correct position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters.
