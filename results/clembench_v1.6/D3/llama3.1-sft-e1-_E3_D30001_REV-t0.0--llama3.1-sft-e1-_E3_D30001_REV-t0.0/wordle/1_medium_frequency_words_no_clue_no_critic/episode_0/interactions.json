You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:41.044804", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: crane\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants, which can help to narrow down the possibilities in the target word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:41.044808", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants, which can help to narrow down the possibilities in the target word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:41.044840", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = axial\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "axial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E3_D30001_REV)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants, which can help to narrow down the possibilities in the target word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:43.205792", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:43.205832", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:Since the letter 'a' is correct but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word that includes 'a' in a different position."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:43.205837", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "Since the letter 'a' is correct but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word that includes 'a' in a different position."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:43.205871", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = axial\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "axial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E3_D30001_REV)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "Since the letter 'a' is correct but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word that includes 'a' in a different position.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:46.744759", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-22T12:07:46.744797", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:glare\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, 'a' is in the word but not in the second position, and 'l' is also in the word but not in the fifth position.
