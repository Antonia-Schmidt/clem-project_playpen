You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:46:52.853889", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:46:52.853893", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:46:52.853926", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = their\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "their", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60004)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:46:58.747929", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:46:58.748004", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:stone\nexplanation:Since all letters in \"apple\" except for 'e' are marked red, I will try a new word with 'e' in a different position and no other letters from \"apple\". \"stone\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:46:58.748009", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "stone", "explanation": "Since all letters in \"apple\" except for 'e' are marked red, I will try a new word with 'e' in a different position and no other letters from \"apple\". \"stone\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:46:58.748064", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = their\nguess: stone\nguess_feedback: s<red> t<yellow> o<red> n<red> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "their", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60004)", "guess": "stone", "explanation": "Since all letters in \"apple\" except for 'e' are marked red, I will try a new word with 'e' in a different position and no other letters from \"apple\". \"stone\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:47:07.538683", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> t<yellow> o<red> n<red> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:47:07.538733", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:treac\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, 't' and 'e' are in the word but not in the positions I guessed.'s', 'o', and 'n' are not in the word.
