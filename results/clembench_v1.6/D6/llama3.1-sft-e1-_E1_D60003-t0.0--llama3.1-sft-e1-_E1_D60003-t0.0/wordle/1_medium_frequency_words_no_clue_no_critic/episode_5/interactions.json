You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:20.885726", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:20.885730", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:20.885764", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = grout\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "grout", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60003)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:26.943431", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:26.943476", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were marked red, I am guessing a new word \"table\" that does not contain any of the letters in \"apple\"."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:26.943481", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were marked red, I am guessing a new word \"table\" that does not contain any of the letters in \"apple\"."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:26.943523", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = grout\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "grout", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60003)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were marked red, I am guessing a new word \"table\" that does not contain any of the letters in \"apple\".", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:34.249503", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:34.249567", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:treac\nexplanation:Since \"t\" is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I am guessing a word \"treac\" that has \"t\" in a different position and does not contain any of the other letters in \"apple\" or \"table\"."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:34.249572", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "treac", "explanation": "Since \"t\" is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I am guessing a word \"treac\" that has \"t\" in a different position and does not contain any of the other letters in \"apple\" or \"table\"."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:34.249597", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD while parsing Player 1's (model: llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60003) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "grout", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60003)", "guess": "treac", "explanation": "Since \"t\" is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I am guessing a word \"treac\" that has \"t\" in a different position and does not contain any of the other letters in \"apple\" or \"table\".", "error": "NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:20:40.516665", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "your guess is not a valid word for this game.
