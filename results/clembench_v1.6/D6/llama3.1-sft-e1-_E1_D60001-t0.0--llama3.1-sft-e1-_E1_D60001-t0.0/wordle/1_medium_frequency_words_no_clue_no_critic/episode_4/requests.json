This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:grape\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" are incorrect except for \"e\", I will try another fruit that has \"e\" in it. \"Grape\" is a five-letter word that has \"e\" in it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> r<yellow> a<red> p<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:creed\nexplanation:Since \"r\" and \"e\" are the only correct letters in the wrong positions, I will try a word that has \"r\" and \"e\" in it. \"Creed\" is a five-letter word that has \"r\" and \"e\" in it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> e<yellow> e<red> d<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:pride\nexplanation:Since \"r\" and \"e\" are the only correct letters in the wrong positions, I will try a word that has \"r\" and \"e\" in it. \"Pride\" is a five-letter word that has \"r\" and \"e\" in it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: p<red> r<yellow> i<red> d<green> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tried\nexplanation:Since \"r\" and \"e\" are the only correct letters in the wrong positions, and \"d\" is in the correct position, I will try a word that has \"r\", \"e\", and \"d\" in it. \"Tried\" is a five-letter word that has \"r\", \"e\", and \"d\" in it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> r<yellow> i<red> e<yellow> d<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
