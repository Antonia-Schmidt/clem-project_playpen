You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:31:59.634944", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:31:59.634948", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:31:59.634992", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = might\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60002)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:06.522457", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:06.522507", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" are incorrect, I will try a completely different word. \"Table\" is another common five-letter English word that does not share any letters with \"apple\"."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:06.522512", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" are incorrect, I will try a completely different word. \"Table\" is another common five-letter English word that does not share any letters with \"apple\"."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:06.522550", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = might\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60002)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" are incorrect, I will try a completely different word. \"Table\" is another common five-letter English word that does not share any letters with \"apple\".", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:19.162183", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:19.162224", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:treac\nexplanation:Since the letter 't' is in the word but not in the first position, and 'a', 'b', 'l', and 'e' are not in the word, I will try a word that has 't' in the second position and does not share any other letters with the previous guesses. \"Treac\" is a valid English word that fits these criteria."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:19.162229", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "treac", "explanation": "Since the letter 't' is in the word but not in the first position, and 'a', 'b', 'l', and 'e' are not in the word, I will try a word that has 't' in the second position and does not share any other letters with the previous guesses. \"Treac\" is a valid English word that fits these criteria."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:19.162245", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD while parsing Player 1's (model: llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60002) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60002)", "guess": "treac", "explanation": "Since the letter 't' is in the word but not in the first position, and 'a', 'b', 'l', and 'e' are not in the word, I will try a word that has 't' in the second position and does not share any other letters with the previous guesses. \"Treac\" is a valid English word that fits these criteria.", "error": "NOT_VALID_ENGLISH_WORD"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:32:32.079995", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "your guess is not a valid word for this game.
