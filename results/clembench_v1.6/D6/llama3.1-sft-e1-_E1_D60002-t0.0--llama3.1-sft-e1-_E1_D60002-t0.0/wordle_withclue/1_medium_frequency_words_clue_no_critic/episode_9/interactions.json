You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:rule\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:41:53.572075", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: law\nexplanation: The clue \"rule\" suggests a word related to governance or regulation, and \"law\" is a common five-letter word that fits that description."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:41:53.572080", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "law", "explanation": "The clue \"rule\" suggests a word related to governance or regulation, and \"law\" is a common five-letter word that fits that description."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:41:53.572096", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60002) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "reign", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60002)", "guess": "law", "explanation": "The clue \"rule\" suggests a word related to governance or regulation, and \"law\" is a common five-letter word that fits that description.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH", "target_word_clue": "rule"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T03:41:59.391715", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
