This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" are marked red, I will try a completely different word with no overlapping letters. \"table\" is a common five-letter English word that does not share any letters with \"apple\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:treac\nexplanation:Since \"t\" is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter English word that starts with \"t\" and does not share any other letters with \"apple\" or \"table\". \"treac\" is a valid word that fits these criteria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
