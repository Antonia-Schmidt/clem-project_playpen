You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:court event\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:59:15.051265", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: match\nexplanation: A match is a court event in tennis, and the word has 5 letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:59:15.051270", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "match", "explanation": "A match is a court event in tennis, and the word has 5 letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:59:15.051304", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = trial\ntarget_word_clue = court event\nguess: match\nguess_feedback: m<red> a<yellow> t<yellow> c<red> h<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "trial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D60005)", "guess": "match", "explanation": "A match is a court event in tennis, and the word has 5 letters.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "court event"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:59:23.777996", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: m<red> a<yellow> t<yellow> c<red> h<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-27T04:59:23.778041", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:trials\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letters 'a' and 't' are correct but in the wrong position.
