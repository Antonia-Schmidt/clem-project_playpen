This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:grape\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" are marked red, I will try a completely different word. \"grape\" is another common five-letter English word that has no letters in common with \"apple\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<yellow> r<red> a<red> p<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:gluey\nexplanation:Since \"g\" is marked yellow, I know that it is a correct letter but in the wrong position.
