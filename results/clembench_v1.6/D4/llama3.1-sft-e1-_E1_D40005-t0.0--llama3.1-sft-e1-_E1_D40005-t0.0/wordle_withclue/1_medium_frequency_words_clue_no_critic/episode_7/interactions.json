You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\n To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: snowy white.\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:just\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:04.622950", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: right\nexplanation: The word \"right\" is often used to indicate that something is correct or appropriate, which fits the clue \"just.\" It also has five letters, making it a valid guess for Wordle."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:04.622955", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "right", "explanation": "The word \"right\" is often used to indicate that something is correct or appropriate, which fits the clue \"just.\" It also has five letters, making it a valid guess for Wordle."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:04.623007", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = newly\ntarget_word_clue = just\nguess: right\nguess_feedback: r<red> i<red> g<red> h<red> t<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "newly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40005)", "guess": "right", "explanation": "The word \"right\" is often used to indicate that something is correct or appropriate, which fits the clue \"just.\" It also has five letters, making it a valid guess for Wordle.", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "just"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:15.181439", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: r<red> i<red> g<red> h<red> t<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:15.181482", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:amiss\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"right\" were incorrect, I am choosing a word that uses different letters and fits the clue \"just.\" \"Amiss\" means \"out of place or not as expected,\" which can be interpreted as \"not just.\" It also has five letters and uses different letters than \"right.\""}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:15.181486", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "amiss", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"right\" were incorrect, I am choosing a word that uses different letters and fits the clue \"just.\" \"Amiss\" means \"out of place or not as expected,\" which can be interpreted as \"not just.\" It also has five letters and uses different letters than \"right.\""}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:15.181523", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = newly\ntarget_word_clue = just\nguess: amiss\nguess_feedback: a<red> m<red> i<red> s<red> s<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "newly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40005)", "guess": "amiss", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"right\" were incorrect, I am choosing a word that uses different letters and fits the clue \"just.\" \"Amiss\" means \"out of place or not as expected,\" which can be interpreted as \"not just.\" It also has five letters and uses different letters than \"right.\"", "error": null, "target_word_clue": "just"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:29.320346", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> m<red> i<red> s<red> s<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:00:29.320426", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:foots\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"amiss\" were incorrect, I am choosing a word that uses different letters and fits the clue \"just.\" \"Foots\" is not a valid word, so I will try \"foots\" with a different letter.
