You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since the letter 'l' is in the correct position and all other letters in the previous guess are incorrect, I am guessing a new word with 'l' in the same position and different letters in the other positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<red> b<red> l<green> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:label\nexplanation:Since the letter 'l' is still in the correct position and all other letters in the previous guess are incorrect, I am guessing a new word with 'l' in the same position and different letters in the other positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> a<red> b<red> e<red> l<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:climb\nexplanation:Since the letter 'l' is in the word but not in the first position, I am guessing a new word with 'l' in the second position and different letters in the other positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<yellow> i<yellow> m<yellow> b<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:limbo\nexplanation:Since the letters 'l', 'i', and'm' are in the word but not in the positions I guessed, I am guessing a new word with 'l', 'i', and'm' in the positions I previously guessed and different letters in the other positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> i<green> m<green> b<red> o<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
