You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:32.337175", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:32.337180", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:32.337228", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = third\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "third", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40005)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:40.386294", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:40.386370", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:crane\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing a completely different word for my second guess. \"Crane\" is another common five-letter English word that does not share any letters with \"apple\"."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:40.386375", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing a completely different word for my second guess. \"Crane\" is another common five-letter English word that does not share any letters with \"apple\"."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:40.386416", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = third\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "third", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40005)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing a completely different word for my second guess. \"Crane\" is another common five-letter English word that does not share any letters with \"apple\".", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:49.155148", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:06:49.155203", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:grape\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letter 'r' is correct but in the wrong position.
