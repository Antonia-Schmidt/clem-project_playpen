This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing a new word with no repeated letters, starting with \"t\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tabby\nexplanation:Given that \"t\" is in the word but not in the second position, and \"a\", \"b\", \"l\", and \"e\" are not in the word, I am trying \"tabby\" to see if it fits the criteria.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> b<red> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:token\nexplanation:Since \"t\" is in the word but not in the second or third positions, and \"a\", \"b\", and \"y\" are not in the word, I am now trying \"token\" to test a new second letter (\"o\") and to see if \"t\" fits in the fourth position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> o<red> k<red> e<red> n<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tuft\nexplanation:With \"t\" being in the word but not in the second, third, or fourth positions, and all other letters from previous guesses being incorrect, I am now trying \"tuft\" to test a new second letter (\"u\") and to see if \"t\" fits in the first and fifth positions.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters.
