This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing a new word with no repeated letters, starting with \"t\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tabby\nexplanation:With the knowledge that the first letter is \"t\" and the second letter is not \"a\", \"b\", or \"l\", I am guessing a word that starts with \"t\" and has a new second letter, \"a\", and continues with \"b\" and \"y\" for the remaining letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> a<red> b<red> b<red> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tweet\nexplanation:Since the first letter is \"t\" and the second letter is not \"a\", \"b\", or \"y\", I am guessing a word that starts with \"t\" and has a new second letter, \"w\", and continues with \"e\" and \"e\" for the remaining letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> w<red> e<red> e<red> t<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:treed\nexplanation:With the knowledge that the first letter is \"t\" and the second letter is not \"w\", \"e\", or \"e\", I am guessing a word that starts with \"t\" and has a new second letter, \"r\", and continues with \"e\" and \"d\" for the remaining letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> r<yellow> e<red> e<red> d<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
