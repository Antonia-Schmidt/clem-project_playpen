You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:27.816368", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:27.816372", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:27.816408", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = court\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "court", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40007)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:31.795675", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:31.795719", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:crane\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"crane\" as it does not contain any of the letters from \"apple\"."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:31.795724", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "crane", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"crane\" as it does not contain any of the letters from \"apple\"."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:31.795759", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = court\nguess: crane\nguess_feedback: c<green> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "court", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40007)", "guess": "crane", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"crane\" as it does not contain any of the letters from \"apple\".", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:38.029812", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<green> r<yellow> a<red> n<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:11:38.029874", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:rocky\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, \"c\" is in the correct position and \"r\" is in the word but in the wrong position.
