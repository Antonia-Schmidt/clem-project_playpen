You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:53:36.064899", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:53:36.064904", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:53:36.064938", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = trial\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "trial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40006)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:53:44.684631", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T14:53:44.684720", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letters 'a' and 'l' are correct but in the wrong position, and the letters 'p' and 'e' are incorrect.
