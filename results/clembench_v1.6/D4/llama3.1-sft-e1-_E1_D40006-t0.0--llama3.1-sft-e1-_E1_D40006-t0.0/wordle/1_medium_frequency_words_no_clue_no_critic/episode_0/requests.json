This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<green> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Since 'a' is in the correct position and 'l' is in the word but in the wrong position, I am guessing \"table\" to test the position of 'l' and to introduce new letters while keeping 'a' in the correct position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> b<red> l<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:aloud\nexplanation:Since 'a' is in the word but not in the first position and 'l' is also in the word but not in the fourth position, I am guessing \"aloud\" to test the position of 'l' and to place 'a' in a different position while introducing new letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<green> l<yellow> o<red> u<red> d<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:clack\nexplanation:Since 'a' is in the correct position and 'l' is in the word but not in the second position, I am guessing \"clack\" to test the position of 'l' and to place 'a' in the correct position while introducing new letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<yellow> a<yellow> c<red> k<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:labial\nexplanation:Since 'l' and 'a' are in the word but not in the positions guessed previously, I am guessing \"labial\" to test the position of 'l' and 'a' while introducing new letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nthe word should have exactly 5 letters.
