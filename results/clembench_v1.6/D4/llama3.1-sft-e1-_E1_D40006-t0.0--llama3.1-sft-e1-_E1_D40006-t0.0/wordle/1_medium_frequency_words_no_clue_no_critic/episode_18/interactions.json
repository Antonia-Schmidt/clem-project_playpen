You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:23.716316", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:23.716321", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:23.716356", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = smart\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "smart", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40006)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:28.405790", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:28.405835", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:Since 'a' is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'a' in a different position and no other letters from the previous guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:28.405840", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "Since 'a' is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'a' in a different position and no other letters from the previous guess."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:28.405875", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = smart\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "smart", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D40006)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "Since 'a' is the only correct letter but in the wrong position, I will try another common five-letter word with 'a' in a different position and no other letters from the previous guess.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:33.649912", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> a<yellow> b<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-02-19T15:03:33.649958", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:train\nexplanation:Both 't' and 'a' are correct but in the wrong positions.
