You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:hello\nexplanation:Since 'l' is in the correct position and 'e' is in the word but in the wrong position, I am guessing \"hello\" because it has 'l' in the correct position and 'e' in a different position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> e<yellow> l<red> l<green> o<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:world\nexplanation:Since 'e' is in the word but not in the second position, and 'l' is in the correct position, I am guessing \"world\" because it has 'e' in a different position and 'l' in the correct position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: w<red> o<red> r<red> l<green> d<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:blaze\nexplanation:Since 'l' and 'd' are in the correct positions, I am guessing \"blaze\" because it has 'l' and 'd' in the correct positions and introduces new letters 'b', 'a', and 'z' to potentially match the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<yellow> a<red> z<red> e<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:leapt\nexplanation:Since 'l' and 'e' are in the word but not in the first, third, fourth, or fifth positions, and 'a', 'z', 'b', and 'o' have been eliminated, I am guessing \"leapt\" because it has 'l' and 'e' in different positions and introduces new letters 'a', 'p', and 't' to potentially match the target word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: l<yellow> e<yellow> a<red> p<red> t<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
