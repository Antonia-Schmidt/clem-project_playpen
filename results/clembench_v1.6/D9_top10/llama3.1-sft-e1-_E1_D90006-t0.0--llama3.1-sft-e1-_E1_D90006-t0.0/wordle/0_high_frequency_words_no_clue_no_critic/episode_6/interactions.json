You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:24.385500", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:24.385504", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:24.385538", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = field\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "field", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90006)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:33.581792", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:33.581833", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:world\nexplanation:Since 'l' is in the correct position and 'e' is in the wrong position, I will try a word with 'l' in the fourth position and 'e' in a different position. \"world\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:33.581838", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "world", "explanation": "Since 'l' is in the correct position and 'e' is in the wrong position, I will try a word with 'l' in the fourth position and 'e' in a different position. \"world\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:33.581871", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = field\nguess: world\nguess_feedback: w<red> o<red> r<red> l<green> d<green>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "field", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90006)", "guess": "world", "explanation": "Since 'l' is in the correct position and 'e' is in the wrong position, I will try a word with 'l' in the fourth position and 'e' in a different position. \"world\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:42.716329", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: w<red> o<red> r<red> l<green> d<green>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:42.716380", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:blade\nexplanation:Since 'l' and 'd' are in the correct positions, I will try a word with 'l' and 'd' in the same positions and replace the other letters with new ones. \"blade\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:42.716385", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "blade", "explanation": "Since 'l' and 'd' are in the correct positions, I will try a word with 'l' and 'd' in the same positions and replace the other letters with new ones. \"blade\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:42.716433", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 3\ntarget_word = field\nguess: blade\nguess_feedback: b<red> l<yellow> a<red> d<yellow> e<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 3, "target_word": "field", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90006)", "guess": "blade", "explanation": "Since 'l' and 'd' are in the correct positions, I will try a word with 'l' and 'd' in the same positions and replace the other letters with new ones. \"blade\" is a common five-letter English word that meets these criteria.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:54.891555", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: b<red> l<yellow> a<red> d<yellow> e<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T15:08:54.891623", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:climb\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, 'l' is in the wrong position, 'd' is in the wrong position, and 'e' is in the correct position.
