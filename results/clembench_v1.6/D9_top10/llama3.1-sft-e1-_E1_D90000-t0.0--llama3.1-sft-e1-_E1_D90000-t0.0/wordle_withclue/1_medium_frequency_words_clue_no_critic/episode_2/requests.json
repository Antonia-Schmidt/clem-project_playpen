This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\nclue:awaiting ignition<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:spark\nexplanation:The clue mentions \"ignition,\" which suggests a spark or a flame.
