This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:house\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that \"a\" and \"l\" are in the word but not in the correct position, and \"p\" is not in the word. \"H\" is a common letter in many English words, and \"o\" and \"u\" are also common letters. \"S\" is a common letter in many English words, especially in the last position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:cloud\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that \"h\", \"o\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are not in the word. \"C\" is a common letter in many English words, and \"l\" is also a common letter. \"O\" and \"d\" are also common letters in many English words.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<yellow> o<red> u<red> d<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:flute\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that \"l\" is in the word but not in the correct position, and \"c\", \"o\", \"u\", and \"d\" are not in the word. \"F\" is a common letter in many English words, and \"t\" is also a common letter. \"E\" is a common letter in many English words, especially in the last position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> l<yellow> u<red> t<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that \"l\" is in the word but not in the correct position, and \"f\", \"u\", and \"e\" are not in the word. \"T\" is a common letter in many English words, and \"a\" is also a common letter. \"B\" is a common letter in many English words, especially in the last position.<|eot_id|>", "clem_player": {"call_start": "2025-01-02 20:18:53.767392", "call_duration": "0:00:12.188654", "response": "guess:table\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that \"l\" is in the word but not in the correct position, and \"f\", \"u\", and \"e\" are not in the word. \"T\" is a common letter in many English words, and \"a\" is also a common letter. \"B\" is a common letter in many English words, especially in the last position.", "model_name": "llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90022"}}}, {"timestamp": "2025-01-02T20:19:22.554968", "manipulated_prompt_obj": {"inputs": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
