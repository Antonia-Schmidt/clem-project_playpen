This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:strength<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:power\nexplanation:The word \"power\" is a common English word that conveys strength and has five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:strength\nguess_agreement:yes\nagreement_explanation:the word \"power\" is a common English word that conveys strength and has five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:power\nexplanation:The word \"power\" is a common English word that conveys strength and has five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: p<red> o<red> w<red> e<red> r<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:force\nexplanation:The word \"force\" is a common English word that conveys strength and has five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:strength\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:The guess feedback indicates that the word \"power\" does not match the clue, as all the letters are in red, indicating they are incorrect.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:force\nexplanation:The word \"force\" is a common English word that conveys strength and has five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> o<red> r<red> c<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:might\nexplanation:The word \"might\" is a common English word that conveys strength and has five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:strength\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:The word \"force\" has the same letters as the guess feedback, but the feedback indicates that all the letters are incorrect.
