This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:train\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I will try a completely different word. \"Train\" is a common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> r<yellow> a<red> i<yellow> n<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:table\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letter 't' is in the correct position, and 'r' and 'i' are in the word but in different positions. \"Table\" is a common five-letter English word that includes these letters in different positions and could be related to the clue if \"apple\" was a mistake.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tabby\nexplanation:Since 't' is in the correct position and 'a', 'b', 'l', and 'e' are not in the word, I will try a word that has 't' in the same position and replace the incorrect letters with other common five-letter words. \"Tabby\" is a common term for a cat with a striped coat pattern, which could be related to the clue if \"apple\" was a mistake.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> a<red> b<red> b<red> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:tabby\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letter 't' is in the correct position, and 'a', 'b', and 'y' are not in the word. \"Tabby\" is a common term for a cat with a striped coat pattern, which could be related to the clue if \"apple\" was a mistake.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: t<green> a<red> b<red> b<red> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
