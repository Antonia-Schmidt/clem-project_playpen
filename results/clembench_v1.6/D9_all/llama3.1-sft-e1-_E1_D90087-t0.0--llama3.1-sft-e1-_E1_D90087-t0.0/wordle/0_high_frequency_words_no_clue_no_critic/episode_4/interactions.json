You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:42.755504", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: house\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:42.755509", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "house", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:42.755540", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = might\nguess: house\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90087)", "guess": "house", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:46.985497", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:46.985537", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:thyme\nexplanation:In the guess_feedback, \"h\" is yellow, indicating that it is correct but in the wrong position. \"o\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are red, indicating that they are incorrect. \"m\" and \"y\" are not present in the guess_feedback, so I am including them in my guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:46.985542", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "thyme", "explanation": "In the guess_feedback, \"h\" is yellow, indicating that it is correct but in the wrong position. \"o\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are red, indicating that they are incorrect. \"m\" and \"y\" are not present in the guess_feedback, so I am including them in my guess."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:46.985576", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = might\nguess: thyme\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> h<yellow> y<red> m<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90087)", "guess": "thyme", "explanation": "In the guess_feedback, \"h\" is yellow, indicating that it is correct but in the wrong position. \"o\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are red, indicating that they are incorrect. \"m\" and \"y\" are not present in the guess_feedback, so I am including them in my guess.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:51.821238", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> h<yellow> y<red> m<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T11:14:51.821279", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:theme\nexplanation:In the guess_feedback, \"t\" and \"h\" are yellow, indicating that they are correct but in the wrong position. \"y\" is red, indicating that it is incorrect. \"m\" and \"e\" are yellow, indicating that they are correct but in the wrong position.
