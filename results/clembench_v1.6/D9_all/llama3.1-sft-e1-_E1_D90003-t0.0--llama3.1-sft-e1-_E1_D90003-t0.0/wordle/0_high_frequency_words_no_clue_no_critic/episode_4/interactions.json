You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:05.181584", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:05.181589", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:05.181635", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = might\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90003)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:12.299514", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:12.299554", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:table\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"table\" as it does not contain any of the letters from the previous guess and provides a new set of letters to test."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:12.299558", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"table\" as it does not contain any of the letters from the previous guess and provides a new set of letters to test."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:12.299590", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = might\nguess: table\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90003)", "guess": "table", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"table\" as it does not contain any of the letters from the previous guess and provides a new set of letters to test.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:23.873303", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> a<red> b<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T14:52:23.873345", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:teeth\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letter 't' is in the word but in the wrong position, and 'a', 'b', 'l', and 'e' are not in the word.
