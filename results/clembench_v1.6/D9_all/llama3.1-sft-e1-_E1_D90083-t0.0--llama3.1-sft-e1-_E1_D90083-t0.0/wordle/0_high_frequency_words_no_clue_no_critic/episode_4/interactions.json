You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:38.917638", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:38.917643", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "house", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:38.917675", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = might\nguess: house\nguess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90083)", "guess": "house", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:44.568039", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<yellow> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:44.568079", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:shine\nexplanation:in the guess_feedback, \"h\" is yellow, indicating that it is a correct letter in the correct position. \"o\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are red, indicating that they are incorrect letters. \"i\" and \"n\" are not present in the guess_feedback, so I am including them in my guess."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:44.568083", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "shine", "explanation": "in the guess_feedback, \"h\" is yellow, indicating that it is a correct letter in the correct position. \"o\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are red, indicating that they are incorrect letters. \"i\" and \"n\" are not present in the guess_feedback, so I am including them in my guess."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:44.568118", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = might\nguess: shine\nguess_feedback: s<red> h<yellow> i<yellow> n<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "might", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90083)", "guess": "shine", "explanation": "in the guess_feedback, \"h\" is yellow, indicating that it is a correct letter in the correct position. \"o\", \"u\", \"s\", and \"e\" are red, indicating that they are incorrect letters. \"i\" and \"n\" are not present in the guess_feedback, so I am including them in my guess.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:51.752152", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> h<yellow> i<yellow> n<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T10:37:51.752190", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:thin\nexplanation:in the guess_feedback, \"h\" is yellow, indicating that it is a correct letter in the correct position. \"i\" is yellow, indicating that it is a correct letter in the wrong position. \"n\" is red, indicating that it is an incorrect letter. \"s\" and \"e\" are red, indicating that they are incorrect letters.
