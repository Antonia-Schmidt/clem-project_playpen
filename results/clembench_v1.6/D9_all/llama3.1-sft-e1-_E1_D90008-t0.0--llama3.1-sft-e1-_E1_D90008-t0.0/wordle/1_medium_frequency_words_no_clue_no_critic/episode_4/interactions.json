You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:34:59.888474", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:34:59.888479", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:34:59.888510", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = trial\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "trial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90008)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:35:08.091437", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:35:08.091478", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:world\nexplanation:Since 'a' and 'l' are in the word but in different positions, and 'p' and 'e' are not in the word, I am guessing \"world\" because it has 'a' and 'l' in different positions and does not include 'p' or 'e'."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:35:08.091483", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "world", "explanation": "Since 'a' and 'l' are in the word but in different positions, and 'p' and 'e' are not in the word, I am guessing \"world\" because it has 'a' and 'l' in different positions and does not include 'p' or 'e'."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:35:08.091517", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = trial\nguess: world\nguess_feedback: w<red> o<red> r<yellow> l<yellow> d<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "trial", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90008)", "guess": "world", "explanation": "Since 'a' and 'l' are in the word but in different positions, and 'p' and 'e' are not in the word, I am guessing \"world\" because it has 'a' and 'l' in different positions and does not include 'p' or 'e'.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:35:17.953035", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: w<red> o<red> r<yellow> l<yellow> d<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-02T16:35:17.953080", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:climb\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, 'r' and 'l' are in the word but in different positions, and 'w', 'o', and 'd' are not in the word.
