You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:45:50.096946", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:45:50.096950", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:45:50.096981", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = grout\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "grout", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90052)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:45:54.896101", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:45:54.896139", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:world\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"world\" as it does not contain any of the letters from the previous guess and provides a new set of letters to test."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:45:54.896143", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "world", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"world\" as it does not contain any of the letters from the previous guess and provides a new set of letters to test."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:45:54.896176", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = grout\nguess: world\nguess_feedback: w<red> o<yellow> r<yellow> l<red> d<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "grout", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90052)", "guess": "world", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I am choosing \"world\" as it does not contain any of the letters from the previous guess and provides a new set of letters to test.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:46:03.155227", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: w<red> o<yellow> r<yellow> l<red> d<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-03T04:46:03.155301", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:woody\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, the letters 'o' and 'r' are in the word but not in the positions I guessed.
