You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:31.768428", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: apple\nexplanation: This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:31.768433", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:31.768469", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = court\nguess: apple\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "court", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90050)", "guess": "apple", "explanation": "This is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:37.496105", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:37.496145", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:train\nexplanation:Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I will try a completely different word. \"Train\" is another common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:37.496150", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "train", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I will try a completely different word. \"Train\" is another common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:37.496183", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = court\nguess: train\nguess_feedback: t<yellow> r<yellow> a<red> i<red> n<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "court", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D90050)", "guess": "train", "explanation": "Since all the letters in \"apple\" were incorrect, I will try a completely different word. \"Train\" is another common five-letter English word that includes a variety of common vowels and consonants.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:48.017282", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: t<yellow> r<yellow> a<red> i<red> n<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2025-01-09T16:50:48.017321", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:crane\nexplanation:Based on the feedback from the previous guess, the letters 't' and 'r' are correct but in the wrong positions.
