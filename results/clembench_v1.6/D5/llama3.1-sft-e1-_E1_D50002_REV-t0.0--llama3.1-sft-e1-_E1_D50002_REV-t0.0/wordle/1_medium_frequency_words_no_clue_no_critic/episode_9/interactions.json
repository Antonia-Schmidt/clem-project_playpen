You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z).

This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:02:15.952183", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: snowy\nexplanation: I am starting with a word that is commonly associated with winter, and the word \"snowy\" has five letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:02:15.952188", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "snowy", "explanation": "I am starting with a word that is commonly associated with winter, and the word \"snowy\" has five letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:02:15.952221", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = reign\nguess: snowy\nguess_feedback: s<red> n<yellow> o<red> w<red> y<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "reign", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D50002_REV)", "guess": "snowy", "explanation": "I am starting with a word that is commonly associated with winter, and the word \"snowy\" has five letters.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:02:20.393048", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: s<red> n<yellow> o<red> w<red> y<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:02:20.393087", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:apple\nexplanation:The feedback indicates that the letter \"n\" is correct but in the wrong position, and the letters \"o\", \"w\", and \"y\" are incorrect.
