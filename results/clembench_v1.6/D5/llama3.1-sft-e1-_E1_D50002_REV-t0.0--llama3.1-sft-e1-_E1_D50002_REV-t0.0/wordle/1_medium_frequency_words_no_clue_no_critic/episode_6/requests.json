This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:snowy\nexplanation:I am starting with a word that is commonly associated with winter, and the word \"snowy\" has five letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> n<red> o<red> w<red> y<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:Based on the feedback, all the letters in \"snowy\" are incorrect.
