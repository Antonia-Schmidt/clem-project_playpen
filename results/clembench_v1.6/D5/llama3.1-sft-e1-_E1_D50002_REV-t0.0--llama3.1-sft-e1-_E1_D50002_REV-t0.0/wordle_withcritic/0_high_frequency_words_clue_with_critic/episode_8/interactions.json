You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nTo help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as\nclue: \"snowy white\"\n\nHere is an example guess based on the clue:\nguess: apple\nexplanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.\n\nI will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nHere are some rules to keep in mind:\n1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:others'\n"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T20:26:19.525564", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: others\nexplanation: The word \"others\" is a five-letter word that fits the clue \"others'\"."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T20:26:19.525569", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "others", "explanation": "The word \"others\" is a five-letter word that fits the clue \"others'\"."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T20:26:19.525583", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D50002_REV) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 0, "target_word": "their", "target_word_difficulty": "high_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D50002_REV)", "guess": "others", "explanation": "The word \"others\" is a five-letter word that fits the clue \"others'\".", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH", "target_word_clue": "others'", "critic_agreement": null, "critic_explanation": null, "guess_critic": "Word Guesser Critic (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D50002_REV)"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-25T20:26:21.152638", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
