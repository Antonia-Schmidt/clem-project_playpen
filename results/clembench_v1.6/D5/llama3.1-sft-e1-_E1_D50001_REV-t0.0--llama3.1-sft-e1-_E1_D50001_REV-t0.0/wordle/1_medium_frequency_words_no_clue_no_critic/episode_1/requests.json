This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<red> p<red> p<red> l<green> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:cloud\nexplanation:Since \"l\" is the only correct letter in the guess_feedback, I am starting my guess with a new word that includes \"l\" and excludes \"a\", \"p\", and \"e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<yellow> o<red> u<red> d<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:flute\nexplanation:Since \"l\" and \"d\" are correct letters in the guess_feedback, and \"l\" is in the correct position, I am starting my guess with a new word that includes \"l\" and \"d\" in the correct positions, and excludes \"c\", \"o\", and \"u\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: f<red> l<yellow> u<red> t<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:slate\nexplanation:Since \"l\" is a correct letter in the guess_feedback, and \"l\" is in the correct position, I am starting my guess with a new word that includes \"l\" in the correct position, and excludes \"f\", \"u\", \"t\", and \"e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: s<red> l<yellow> a<red> t<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:glide\nexplanation:Since \"l\" is a correct letter in the guess_feedback, and \"l\" is in the correct position, I am starting my guess with a new word that includes \"l\" in the correct position, and excludes \"s\", \"a\", \"t\", and \"e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: g<red> l<yellow> i<yellow> d<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n", "max_new_tokens": 100, "temperature": 0.0, "return_full_text": false}, "raw_response_obj": {"response": "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\n\nCutting Knowledge Date: December 2023\nToday Date: 26 Jul 2024\n\n<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nYou are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.\n\nWelcome to Wordle!
