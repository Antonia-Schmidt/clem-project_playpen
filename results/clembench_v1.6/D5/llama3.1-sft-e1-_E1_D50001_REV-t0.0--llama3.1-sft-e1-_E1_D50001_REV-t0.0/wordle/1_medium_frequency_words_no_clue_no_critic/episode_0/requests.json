This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<green> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:apple\nexplanation:Since 'a' is correct and 'p' is incorrect, and 'l' is correct but in the wrong position, my next guess is a word that starts with 'a', contains 'l' in a different position, and does not contain 'p'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<green> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:aline\nexplanation:Since 'a' is correct and 'l' is correct but in the wrong position, my next guess is a word that starts with 'a', contains 'l' in a different position, and does not contain 'p'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<green> l<yellow> i<green> n<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:aline\nexplanation:Since 'a' is correct and 'l' is correct but in the wrong position, and 'i' is correct but in the wrong position, my next guess is a word that starts with 'a', contains 'l' in a different position, contains 'i' in a different position, and does not contain 'p' or 'n'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: a<green> l<yellow> i<green> n<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:alice\nexplanation:Since 'a' is correct and 'l' is correct but in the wrong position, and 'i' is correct but in the wrong position, my next guess is a word that starts with 'a', contains 'l' in a different position, contains 'i' in a different position, and does not contain 'p' or 'n'.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nyour guess is not a valid word for this game.
