Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own\n2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess.\n\nclue:crow<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:cloud\nexplanation:The clue \"crow\" suggests a word related to birds, and \"cloud\" is a valid English word of five lowercase letters that fits this theme.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nclue:crow\nguess_agreement:no\nagreement_explanation:the guess \"cloud\" does not match the clue \"crow\" because \"crow\" is a noun referring to a bird, and \"cloud\" is a noun referring to a weather phenomenon, which are different themes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:crane\nexplanation:Since the guess \"cloud\" does not match the clue \"crow\", I will try a new guess that is a noun referring to a bird, like \"crow\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess_feedback: c<red> r<red> a<yellow> n<red> e<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nguess:brack\nexplanation:Given the guess feedback, the letter \"a\" is correct but in the wrong position, and the letters \"c\", \"r\", \"n\", and \"e\" are incorrect.
