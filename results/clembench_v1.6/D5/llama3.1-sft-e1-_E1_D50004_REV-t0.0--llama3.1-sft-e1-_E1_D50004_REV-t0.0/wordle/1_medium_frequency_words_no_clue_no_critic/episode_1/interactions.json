You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags \"guess:\" and \"explanation:\" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.\n\nFor instance, if your guess is \"apple\", your response should be\nguess: apple\n explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.\n\nAfter each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.\n\nFor example, the feedback for \"apple\" might be:\nguess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>\n\nThe explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.\n\nLet's begin with your first guess."}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:16:56.125444", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess: house\nexplanation: this is a common five-letter English word that starts with the letter h."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:16:56.125449", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "house", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word that starts with the letter h."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:16:56.125481", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 1\ntarget_word = dimly\nguess: house\nguess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>", "game_info": {"attempts": 1, "target_word": "dimly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D50004_REV)", "guess": "house", "explanation": "this is a common five-letter English word that starts with the letter h.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:16:58.247712", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: h<red> o<red> u<red> s<red> e<red>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:16:58.247753", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:cloud\nexplanation:since the previous guess contained only one correct letter (h), which was marked as red, I am trying a new word that starts with a different letter."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:16:58.247758", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "cloud", "explanation": "since the previous guess contained only one correct letter (h), which was marked as red, I am trying a new word that starts with a different letter."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:16:58.247791", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "attempts: 2\ntarget_word = dimly\nguess: cloud\nguess_feedback: c<red> l<yellow> o<red> u<red> d<yellow>", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "dimly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D50004_REV)", "guess": "cloud", "explanation": "since the previous guess contained only one correct letter (h), which was marked as red, I am trying a new word that starts with a different letter.", "error": null}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:17:00.264499", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "guess_feedback: c<red> l<yellow> o<red> u<red> d<yellow>"}}, {"from": "Player 1", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:17:00.264538", "action": {"type": "get message", "content": "guess:cloudy\nexplanation:since the previous guess contained some correct letters in the wrong position (l and d), I am trying a new word that includes these letters."}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:17:00.264542", "action": {"type": "parse", "content": {"guess": "cloudy", "explanation": "since the previous guess contained some correct letters in the wrong position (l and d), I am trying a new word that includes these letters."}}}, {"from": "GM", "to": "GM", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:17:00.264557", "action": {"type": "metadata", "content": "Guesser Error: INVALID_WORD_LENGTH while parsing Player 1's (model: llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D50004_REV) response", "game_info": {"attempts": 2, "target_word": "dimly", "target_word_difficulty": "medium_frequency", "guesser": "Word Guesser (llama3.1-sft-e1-_E1_D50004_REV)", "guess": "cloudy", "explanation": "since the previous guess contained some correct letters in the wrong position (l and d), I am trying a new word that includes these letters.", "error": "INVALID_WORD_LENGTH"}}}], [{"from": "GM", "to": "Player 1", "timestamp": "2024-11-23T23:17:02.278855", "action": {"type": "send message", "content": "the word should have exactly 5 letters.
