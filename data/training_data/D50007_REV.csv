Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size. Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
You are also given a referring expression that describes one of the given grids. The goal is to select a grid that matches the given referring expression.
Here is an example with grids and the referring expression.
Generate only the number (in text) of the grid that the given expression matches to by selecting first, second, or third. Start with the tag ""Answer: "" and followed by the generated expression.

First grid:

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size. Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
You are also given a referring expression that describes one of the given grids. The goal is to select a grid that matches the given referring expression.
Here is an example with grids and the referring expression.
Generate only the number (in text) of the grid that the given expression matches to by selecting first, second, or third. Start with the tag ""Answer: "" and followed by the generated expression.

First grid:

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Second grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
X X X X X

Third grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
X X X X X

The referring expression for the given target grid is like so:
Expression: Filled as T.

Ok. Now do this for the following grids.

Target grid:

X X ▢ X X
X ▢ ▢ ▢ X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
X ▢ ▢ ▢ X
X X ▢ X X

Second grid:

X X ▢ X ▢
X ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X
X X ▢ X ▢

Third grid:

▢ X ▢ ▢ X
X ▢ ▢ ▢ X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ X
▢ X ▢ X X

Generate the referring expression for the given target.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Second grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
X X X X X

Third grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
X X X X X

The referring expression for the given target grid is like so:
Expression: Filled as T.

Ok. Now do this for the following grids.

Target grid:

▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢

Second grid:

▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢

Third grid:

▢ X ▢ X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X ▢ ▢
▢ X X X ▢

Generate the referring expression for the given target.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

Expression: Filled vertical line of Xs in the middle with empty cells on both sides.<|eot_id|>"

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

X X X X X

Third grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
X X X X X

The referring expression for the given target grid is like so:
Expression: Filled as T.

Ok. Now do this for the following grids.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ ▢ X ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢
X X X X X

Second grid:

▢ X X ▢ ▢

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Second grid:

X X X X X

X X X X X

Third grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ ▢ ▢ ▢
X X X X X

The referring expression for the given target grid is like so:
Expression: Filled as T.

Ok. Now do this for the following grids.

Target grid:

▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X X ▢

Second grid:

▢ X X X ▢
▢ X X ▢ ▢

▢ X ▢ ▢ ▢

Third grid:

▢ X X X ▢

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

You are also given a referring expression that describes one of the given grids. The goal is to select a grid that matches the given referring expression.
Here is an example with grids and the referring expression.
Generate only the number (in text) of the grid that the given expression matches to by selecting first, second, or third. Start with the tag ""Answer: "" and followed by the generated expression.

First grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size. Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
You are also given a referring expression that describes one of the given grids. The goal is to select a grid that matches the given referring expression.
Here is an example with grids and the referring expression.
Generate only the number (in text) of the grid that the given expression matches to by selecting first, second, or third. Start with the tag ""Answer: "" and followed by the generated expression.
