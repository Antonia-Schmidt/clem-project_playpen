The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X

The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢

Let us play a game. You are given three grids where each of them is 5 by 5 in size.
Grids have empty cells marked with ""▢"" and filled cells marked with ""X"".
The goal is to generate a single referring expression that captures the main content in the grid named as ""Target grid"".
Generate the referring expression starting with the tag ""Expression: "" for the given target grid and exclude any other text.

Here is an example with grids. The first grid is the target grid and the following two grids are distractors.

Target grid:

X X X X X
▢ ▢ X ▢ ▢
