 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: snowy white.

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.

Let's begin with your first guess.
clue:power<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess: force
explanation: The word ""force"" is commonly associated with power, as it can refer to physical strength or energy exerted. It is a five-letter English word that fits the clue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

guess_feedback: f<red> o<red> r<red> c<green> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess: peace
explanation: The feedback indicated that the letters 'c' and 'e' are correct and in the correct positions, while 'f', 'o', and 'r' are not in the word. The word ""peace"" contains the letters 'c' and 'e' in the same positions as the feedback suggests and is a concept often associated with the power of diplomacy and harmony. It is also a five-letter word that fits the clue.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

guess_feedback: p<red> e<red> a<red> c<green> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess: since
explanation: The feedback from the previous guess confirms that the letters 'c' and 'e' are correct and in the correct positions at the end of the word. The letters 'p', 'e', and 'a' are incorrect. The word ""since"" includes the correct 'c' and 'e' at the end, and it is a new attempt with different letters at the beginning, which could be associated with the clue ""power"" in the sense of ""<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

guess_feedback: s<red> i<yellow> n<red> c<green> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess:voice
explanation:The feedback indicates that 'i' is in the word but in the wrong position, while 'c' and 'e' are correct and in the right positions. The word ""voice"" is associated with power in the sense of having a say or influence, and it fits the pattern with 'i' moved to the second position, and 'c' and 'e' at the end of the word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

guess_feedback: v<red> o<red> i<green> c<green> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess:juice
explanation:The feedback shows that 'i', 'c', and 'e' are correct and in the right positions, while 'v' and 'o' are not in the word. The word ""juice"" fits the given pattern with 'i', 'c', and 'e' in the second, fourth, and fifth positions, respectively. Additionally, ""juice"" can metaphorically relate to power, as in having the ""juice"" to get things<|eot_id|>"

 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: snowy white.

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.

 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: snowy white.

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: snowy white.

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: snowy white.

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.

Let's begin with your first guess.
