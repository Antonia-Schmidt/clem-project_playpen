You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: snowy white.

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.

Let's begin with your first guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as

guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own

You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

<|im_start|>assistant
Certainly! I'm ready to play Wordle based on the given rules. Let's start with the first guess based on the clue ""embark"".

guess: board
explanation: The word ""board"" is closely associated with the concept of embarking. When we embark on a journey, we often board a vehicle, such as a ship or plane. Additionally, ""board"" is a five-letter word that fits the Wordle criteria.<|im_end|>

clue:embark

Thank you for agreeing with my guess. I'll proceed with ""board"" as my first guess.

<|im_start|>assistant
guess: start
explanation: Based on the feedback from the previous guess, we know that the third and fourth letters are 'a' and 'r' respectively.

This word maintains the connection to the clue while incorporating the correct letters from the previous feedback.<|im_end|>

clue:embark
guess_agreement:no
agreement_explanation:While ""party"" does fit the pattern from the previous feedback with 'a' and 'r' in the correct positions and 't' present, it doesn't strongly relate to the clue ""embark"". Embarking typically implies starting a journey or venture, which isn't closely associated with a party.

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:
clue:snow white
guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.

Let's begin!

clue:insignificant
guess:small
explanation:The word ""small"" directly relates to the clue ""insignificant"" as something that is insignificant is often considered small in size, importance, or impact. The word ""small"" fits the criteria of being a valid English word with five lowercase letters.

explanation:With the feedback indicating that 'm' is in the wrong position and all other letters from the previous guess ""minor"" being incorrect, I chose ""amble.""

This word rearranges 'm' and 's' to new positions and introduces entirely new letters 'a', 'c', and 'k'. While ""smack"" doesn't directly align

explanation:Based on the feedback, 's' is correctly placed at the beginning, and both 'l' and 'm' are correct but in the wrong positions. The letters 'u' and 'p' are incorrect.

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:
clue:snow white
guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

It seems like there's been a mistake! The agreement explanation seems to be referencing the original guess ""board"", not the current guess ""cargo"".

You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

explanation: The clue ""embark"" makes me think of boarding a ship or a vehicle to start a journey. The word ""board"" has 5 letters and seems like a fitting choice.<|im_end|>

clue:embark

It seems like there's been a mistake! The agreement explanation seems to be referencing the original guess ""board"", not the current guess ""cargo"".

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:

Let's begin with your first guess.
clue:not very intelligently
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: silly
explanation: The clue ""not very intelligently"" suggests the word ""silly,"" which means lacking in good sense or intelligence. It's a 5-letter word that fits the clue.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
guess_feedback: s<red> i<green> l<red> l<green> y<green><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess:dimly
explanation:
From the feedback:
- **Position 1**: The letter **'s'** is **red**, so **'s'** is not in the word.
- **Position 2**: The letter **'i'** is **green**, so **'i'** is correct at this position.
- **Position 3**: The letter **'l'** is **red**, so there is **no 'l'** at this position.
- **Position 4**: The letter **'l'** is **green**, so **'l'** is correct at this position.
- **Position 5**: The letter **'y'** is **green**, so **'y'** is correct at this position.

So the word has the pattern: **\_ i \_ l y**

Considering the clue **""not very intelligently""**, the word **""dimly""** fits:
- **""Dimly""** means doing something in a way that lacks clarity or full understanding, which aligns with ""not very intelligently.""
- It matches the known letter positions:
  - **Position 1**: **'d'** (unknown but acceptable since it's not **'s'**)
  - **Position 2**: **'i'** (matches the green feedback)
  - **Position 3**: **'m'** (a new letter, not previously ruled out)
  - **Position 4**: **'l'** (matches the green feedback)
  - **Position 5**: **'y'** (matches the green feedback)
- None of the letters conflict with the feedback.<|im_end|>

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

The letters 'c', 'r', 'n', 'e', 'f', and 'h' are not in the word. I need a word that fits the pattern '\_\_a\_\_', includes 'l' (not in position 2), and 's' (not in position 4). Considering these constraints, I chose 'stall' because it meets all criteria and uses common letters that may help reveal more about the target word.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
guess_feedback: s<green> t<red> a<green> l<green> l<green><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess:small
explanation:From the feedback, I have the following information:

- The word starts with **'s'** (position 0 is **'s'**, confirmed from ""stall"").
- The letter **'a'** is correct at position 2 (from all previous guesses).
- The letters **'l'** are correct at positions 3 and 4 (from ""stall"").
- The letter **'l'** is **not** at position 1 (since in ""flash"", **'l'** at position 1 was yellow).
- The letters **'c'**, **'r'**, **'n'**, **'e'**, **'f'**, **'h'**, and **'t'** are not in the word.

So the word fits the pattern:

**s \_ a l l**

We need to find a valid English word that fits this pattern, where the missing letter at position 1 is a letter we haven't ruled out. Considering the remaining letters, **'m'** is a common consonant that hasn't been excluded. Placing **'m'** at position 1 gives us the word **""small""**, which satisfies all the given feedback and constraints.<|im_end|>

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

You are Qwen, created by Alibaba Cloud. You are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

clue:insignificant
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: small
explanation: The word ""small"" directly relates to the clue ""insignificant"" as something that is insignificant is often considered small in size, importance, or impact. The word ""small"" fits the criteria of being a valid English word with five lowercase letters.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:yes
agreement_explanation:The word ""small"" is a direct synonym of ""insignificant,"" fitting the criteria of a 5-letter word that is relevant to the clue provided.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: minor
explanation: Given the agreement with the word ""small"" and its relevance to ""insignificant,"" another synonym that fits the criteria of a 5-letter word is ""minor."" This word also conveys a sense of being less important or insignificant, aligning with the clue provided.<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
guess: amble
explanation: With the feedback indicating that 'm' is in the wrong position and all other letters from the previous guess ""minor"" being incorrect, I chose ""amble."" This word includes 'm' in a new position and introduces entirely new letters to match the 5-letter criteria, while also exploring a different direction since the direct synonyms of ""insignificant"" have not led to the correct answer yet. Although ""amble"" doesn't directly relate to ""insign<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:no
agreement_explanation:the word ""amble"" does not fit the clue ""insignificant"" as it refers to a leisurely walking pace, not to the concept of being insignificant or minor in importance.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: misty
explanation: Acknowledging the previous oversight of not providing a valid 5-letter word and considering the clue ""insignificant"" alongside the feedback that 'm' is correct but was in the wrong position, ""misty"" is chosen. While ""misty"" primarily describes weather conditions, it metaphorically can imply something that is unclear or not solid, hence touching on the notion of being insignificant or hard to discern.

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:
clue:snow white
guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.

Let's begin!

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: snowy white.

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.

Let's begin with your first guess.

guess: minor

explanation: ""Minor"" means ""insignificant,"" so it fits the clue and is a five-letter English word.<|im_end|>

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

 To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: snowy white.

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how both the guess_feedback and clue work together in tandem to formulate a new guess.

Let's begin with your first guess.

<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: minor

explanation: ""Minor"" means ""insignificant,"" so it fits the clue and is a five-letter English word.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
guess_feedback: m<yellow> i<red> n<red> o<red> r<red><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: small

explanation: Considering the clue ""insignificant,"" the word ""small"" fits as a synonym. From the previous feedback, we know that ""m"" is in the word but not in the first position (since ""m"" was yellow in ""minor""). ""Small"" places ""m"" in the second position. Additionally, it doesn't include any of the letters ""i,"" ""n,"" ""o,"" or ""r,"" which we know are not in the target word based on the red feedback from ""minor.""<|im_end|>

<|im_start|>assistant
guess: small
explanation: The word ""small"" directly relates to the clue ""insignificant"" as something that is insignificant is often considered small in size, importance, or impact. The word ""small"" fits the criteria of being a valid English word with five lowercase letters.<|im_end|>

clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:yes
agreement_explanation:The word ""small"" is a direct synonym of ""insignificant,"" fitting the criteria of a 5-letter word that is relevant to the clue provided.

guess: minor
explanation: Given the agreement with the word ""small"" and its relevance to ""insignificant,"" another synonym that fits the criteria of a 5-letter word is ""minor."" This word also conveys a sense of being less important or insignificant, aligning with the clue provided.<|im_end|>

This word includes 'm' in a new position and introduces entirely new letters to match the 5-letter criteria, while also exploring a different direction since the direct synonyms of ""insignificant"" have not led to the correct answer yet.

agreement_explanation:the word ""amble"" does not fit the clue ""insignificant"" as it refers to a leisurely walking pace, not to the concept of being insignificant or minor in importance.

guess: misty
explanation: Acknowledging the previous oversight of not providing a valid 5-letter word and considering the clue ""insignificant"" alongside the feedback that 'm' is correct but was in the wrong position, ""misty"" is chosen. While ""misty"" primarily describes weather conditions, it metaphorically can imply something that is unclear or not solid, hence touching on the notion of being insignificant or hard to discern.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

clue:insignificant
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: small
explanation: The word ""small"" directly relates to the clue ""insignificant"" as something that is insignificant is often considered small in size, importance, or impact. The word ""small"" fits the criteria of being a valid English word with five lowercase letters.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:yes
agreement_explanation:The word ""small"" is a direct synonym of ""insignificant,"" fitting the criteria of a 5-letter word that is relevant to the clue provided.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: minor
explanation: Given the agreement with the word ""small"" and its relevance to ""insignificant,"" another synonym that fits the criteria of a 5-letter word is ""minor."" This word also conveys a sense of being less important or insignificant, aligning with the clue provided.<|im_end|>

explanation: With the feedback indicating that 'm' is in the wrong position and all other letters from the previous guess ""minor"" being incorrect, I chose ""amble."" This word includes 'm' in a new position and introduces entirely new letters to match the 5-letter criteria, while also exploring a different direction since the direct synonyms of ""insignificant"" have not led to the correct answer yet. Although ""amble"" doesn't directly relate to ""insign<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:no
agreement_explanation:the word ""amble"" does not fit the clue ""insignificant"" as it refers to a leisurely walking pace, not to the concept of being insignificant or minor in importance.

<|im_start|>assistant
guess: misty
explanation: Acknowledging the previous oversight of not providing a valid 5-letter word and considering the clue ""insignificant"" alongside the feedback that 'm' is correct but was in the wrong position, ""misty"" is chosen. While ""misty"" primarily describes weather conditions, it metaphorically can imply something that is unclear or not solid, hence touching on the notion of being insignificant or hard to discern.

1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

Let's begin with your first guess.

clue:insignificant
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: small
explanation: The word ""small"" directly relates to the clue ""insignificant"" as something that is insignificant is often considered small in size, importance, or impact. The word ""small"" fits the criteria of being a valid English word with five lowercase letters.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:yes
agreement_explanation:The word ""small"" is a direct synonym of ""insignificant,"" fitting the criteria of a 5-letter word that is relevant to the clue provided.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: minor
explanation: Given the agreement with the word ""small"" and its relevance to ""insignificant,"" another synonym that fits the criteria of a 5-letter word is ""minor."" This word also conveys a sense of being less important or insignificant, aligning with the clue provided.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
guess_feedback: m<yellow> i<red> n<red> o<red> r<red><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: amble
explanation: With the feedback indicating that 'm' is in the wrong position and all other letters from the previous guess ""minor"" being incorrect, I chose ""amble."" This word includes 'm' in a new position and introduces entirely new letters to match the 5-letter criteria, while also exploring a different direction since the direct synonyms of ""insignificant"" have not led to the correct answer yet. Although ""amble"" doesn't directly relate to ""insign<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:no
agreement_explanation:the word ""amble"" does not fit the clue ""insignificant"" as it refers to a leisurely walking pace, not to the concept of being insignificant or minor in importance.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: misty
explanation: Acknowledging the previous oversight of not providing a valid 5-letter word and considering the clue ""insignificant"" alongside the feedback that 'm' is correct but was in the wrong position, ""misty"" is chosen. While ""misty"" primarily describes weather conditions, it metaphorically can imply something that is unclear or not solid, hence touching on the notion of being insignificant or hard to discern. This guess also corrects the letter count issue<|im_end|>

guess_feedback: m<yellow> i<red> s<yellow> t<red> y<red><|im_end|>

guess:smack
explanation:Given the feedback that 'm' and 's' are correct letters but were in the wrong positions in ""misty,"" and considering the other letters 'i', 't', and 'y' are incorrect, ""smack"" is chosen as the next guess. This word rearranges 'm' and 's' to new positions and introduces entirely new letters 'a', 'c', and 'k'. While ""smack"" doesn't directly align<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:no
agreement_explanation:the clue ""insignificant"" does not relate to the word ""smack,"" which refers to a sharp slap or blow, not to something being insignificant in size, importance, or impact.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess:slump
explanation:Acknowledging the feedback that 'm' and 's' are correct but were in the wrong positions and that my previous guess ""smack"" did not align with the clue ""insignificant,"" I am now choosing ""slump."" This word rearranges 's' and 'm' into new positions and introduces 'l', 'u', and 'p'. ""Slump"" can metaphorically suggest a decline or a decrease in importance or value,<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
guess_feedback: s<green> l<yellow> u<red> m<yellow> p<red><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess:slims
explanation:Based on the feedback, 's' is correctly placed at the beginning, and both 'l' and 'm' are correct but in the wrong positions. The letters 'u' and 'p' are incorrect. Therefore, ""slims"" is chosen as it retains the correct 's', moves 'l' and 'm' to new positions, and introduces 'i' instead of the incorrect letters, fitting the 5-letter requirement and attempting to<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:no
agreement_explanation:the guess ""slims"" does not rearrange 'l' and 'm' to new positions as required by the feedback, since 'l' and 'm' remain in their previous positions from the guess ""slump"".
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess:smalt
explanation:Correcting the oversight in my previous guess where 'l' and 'm' were not moved to new positions as they should have been based on the feedback, ""smalt"" is chosen. This guess correctly places 's' at the beginning, as indicated by the green feedback, and attempts to rearrange 'l' and 'm' into new positions while introducing 'a' and 't', replacing the incorrect 'u' and 'p'. This<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
guess_feedback: s<green> m<green> a<green> l<green> t<red><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess:smalt
explanation:Given the feedback, it appears there was a misunderstanding in the process. Since ""smalt"" has already been guessed and almost all letters except 't' were correct, a correction is needed in my approach. However, based on the feedback provided, it seems I inadvertently repeated the guess. Let's correct the course based on the feedback.

guess:smalt
explanation:Acknowledging the error in repeating the guess ""smalt"" and considering the feedback<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
clue:insignificant
guess_agreement:no
agreement_explanation:the explanation provided does not match the feedback given for ""smalt,"" as there is no previous feedback indicating that ""smalt"" was guessed before. Additionally, the explanation mistakenly refers to a scenario that wasn't presented in the provided information. The correct approach should directly address the feedback for the current guess, which indicates that 's', 'm', 'a', and 'l' are correct and in their correct positions, while 't' is incorrect.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess:small
explanation:Correcting my previous oversight and directly addressing the feedback for ""smalt,"" which indicated that 's', 'm', 'a', and 'l' are correct and in their correct positions, but 't' is incorrect, the correct guess based on this feedback is ""small."" This word fits the clue ""insignificant"" perfectly, as something small can be considered insignificant in size or importance.<|im_end|>

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:

guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:
clue:snow white
guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.

Let's begin!

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:
clue:snow white
guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.

Let's begin!

clue:the a in ""cat scan""
guess:axial
explanation:In a ""CAT scan,"" the ""A"" stands for ""axial,"" so ""the a in 'cat scan'"" refers to ""axial.""
<|im_end|>

agreement:yes
explanation:the 'a' in 'cat scan' stands for 'axial', which is a 5-letter word matching the clue.<|im_end|>

- The second letter is **'l'** (green in **'black'** and **'aloft'**).
- The third letter is **'o'** (green in **'aloft'**).
- The fifth letter is **'t'** (green in **'aloft'**).
- The letter **'a'** is in the word but not in positions 1, 2, or 3 (yellow in **'raven'**, **'black'**, and **'aloft'**), so it must be in position 4.
- The letters **r**, **v**, **e**, **n**, **b**, **c**, **k**, and **f** are not in the word (all red in previous guesses).

This means the word fits the pattern **\* l o a t**.

The only common English word that fits this pattern is **'gloat'**.

Furthermore, **'gloat'** means to boast or *crow* about something, which aligns with the clue **""crow""**.<|im_end|>

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:
clue:snow white
guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.

Let's begin!

clue:the a in ""cat scan""

explanation:The term ""CAT scan"" refers to a medical imaging procedure known as a ""CT scan,"" where ""CT"" stands for ""Computed Tomography."" The clue ""the a in 'cat scan'"" suggests looking for a word related to this context.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be
guess: apple
 explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.

Let's begin with your first guess.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: slate

explanation: I chose ""slate"" as my first guess because it includes common consonants (s, l, t) and vowels (a, e), which should help identify which letters are in the target word.<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>user
guess_feedback: s<red> l<yellow> a<red> t<red> e<red><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: could
explanation: From the feedback, I learned that 'l' is in the word but not in the second position. The letters 's', 'a', 't', and 'e' are not in the word. So, I chose ""could"" because it includes 'l' in a different position and doesn't use any of the letters that were marked red.<|im_end|>

I chose ""idyll"" because it places 'l' at the correct fourth position, moves 'd' to a new position (second), and uses new letters ('i' and 'y') that haven't been ruled out.

<|im_start|>user
guess_feedback: i<yellow> d<yellow> y<yellow> l<green> l<red><|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
guess: dimly
explanation: Based on the feedback:

- 'l' is confirmed in the fourth position.
- 'd' is in the word but not in positions 2 or 5, so it could be in positions 1 or 3. I chose to place it in position 1.
- 'i' is in the word but not in position 1, so I placed it in position 2.
- 'y' is in the word but not in position 3, so I placed it in position 5.
- There is only one 'l' in the word, so I included it once in the correct position.
- The letters 's', 'a', 't', 'e', 'c', 'o', 'u', and 'l' (second occurrence) are not in the word.
- 'm' is a new letter that hasn't been tried yet.

Therefore, ""dimly"" fits all the known clues and introduces a new letter to help identify any remaining correct letters.<|im_end|>

A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.
