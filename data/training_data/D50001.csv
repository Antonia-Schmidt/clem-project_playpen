Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be
guess: apple
 explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be
guess: apple
 explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be
guess: apple
 explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be
guess: apple
 explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be
guess: apple
 explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.

Let's begin with your first guess.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess: apple
explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<red> p<red> l<yellow> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess: whale
explanation: Based on the feedback, ""a"" and ""l"" are correct but in the wrong positions, and ""e"" is in the correct position. I am guessing ""whale"" because it has ""a"" and ""l"" in different positions and ""e"" in the correct position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

guess_feedback: w<red> h<red> a<green> l<yellow> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess:table
explanation: Based on the feedback, ""a"" and ""e"" are in the correct positions, and ""l"" is correct but in the wrong position. I am guessing ""table"" because it has ""a"" and ""e"" in the correct positions and ""l"" in a different position.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

guess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> b<yellow> l<yellow> e<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

guess:blade
explanation:Based on the feedback, ""a"", ""b"", and ""l"" are correct but in the wrong positions, and ""e"" is in the correct position. I am guessing ""blade"" because it has ""a"", ""b"", and ""l"" in different positions and ""e"" in the correct position.<|eot_id|>"
