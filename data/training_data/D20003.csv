You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be
guess: apple
 explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

For instance, if your guess is ""apple"", your response should be
guess: apple
 explanation: this is a common five-letter English word, and I am starting my guess with this word.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

The explanation should contain details about how the guess_feedback is used to arrive at a new guess.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

You are a language wizard who likes to guess words by using the given rules.

Welcome to Wordle! You have six attempts to guess the target word, a valid English word of five lowercase letters (a-z). Please use the tags ""guess:"" and ""explanation:"" to provide a concise explanation for each guess.

To help you make an informed guess, you will receive a clue for the word, such as
clue: ""snowy white""

Here is an example guess based on the clue:
guess: apple
explanation: In the fairy tail Snow White, the girl is killed because she eats a poisoned apple. And the word apple has 5 letters.

I will then indicate whether I agree or disagree with your guess and provide rationale, but agreeing with a guess does not confirm its correctness. You may choose to retain your original guess or modify it based on given clue and agreement.

After each guess, your answer will be validated, and you will receive feedback indicating which letters are correct (green), which letters are correct but in the wrong position (yellow), and which letters are incorrect (red). This feedback can be useful in determining which letters to include or exclude in your next guess.

For example, the feedback for ""apple"" might be:
guess_feedback: a<yellow> p<yellow> p<green> l<yellow> e<red>

Here are some rules to keep in mind:
1. Please do not generate any guess feedback or clue on your own
2. Use the clue, my agreement or disagreement, and guess feedback to arrive at your next guess. This should be reflected in your explanation as well.

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:
clue:snow white
guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

explanation:Salsa is a type of lively dance and the word has 5 letters.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

clue:lively dance
guess:samba
explanation:Based on the feedback, the second letter could be 'a' and the last letter could be 'o'. However, there are not many 5-letter dance names that fit this pattern. So, I will guess 'samba', another lively dance, to check for other possible correct letters.
guess_feedback: t<red> a<yellow> n<red> g<red> o<yellow><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

agreement:no
explanation:Based on the feedback, the second letter 'a' and the last letter 'o' are correct but in the wrong position. However, your guess 'samba' does not have 'o' as the last letter and 'a' is not in the second position. Therefore, your guess does not match the feedback.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

clue:lively dance
guess:boast
explanation:Based on the feedback, the second letter could be 'a' and the fourth letter could be 'o'. The word 'boast' fits this pattern. Although it's not a dance, it can be associated with a lively dance floor where people might boast about their dance skills.
guess_feedback: c<red> h<red> a<yellow> o<yellow> s<red><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

explanation:Although the word 'boast' fits the pattern of the feedback, it doesn't directly relate to the clue 'lively dance'. The word should ideally be a type of dance or something directly associated with dance.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

clue:lively dance
guess:opera
explanation:Based on the feedback, the second letter of the word is 'a'. The word 'opera' fits this pattern. Although it's not a dance, it can be associated with a lively performance which can include dance.
guess_feedback: r<red> u<red> m<red> b<red> a<green><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

agreement:no
explanation:Based on the feedback, the second letter is not 'a', it's in the wrong position. The last letter is 'a' which is in the correct position. The word 'opera' does not fit this pattern. Also, opera is not typically associated with a lively dance.<|eot_id|>"

I need your assistance with a word game in which we need to find a 5-letter word using a clue, a guess and an explanation for the guess.

For example, if the clue is ""snow white"" and the guess is ""apple"", you will get the information like this:
clue:snow white
guess:apple
explanation:the fairy tale Snow White involves the girl eating a poisoned apple, which has 5 letters.

Your task is to either agree or disagree with my guess based on the given clue.

If you disagree, I will make another guess, and if you agree, I will proceed in the game using the same guess.

Initially, guess feedback is not available, but as the game proceeds, it becomes available. The guess feedback is not for current guess, but rather an indication of what letters can be present in the current guess. A letter highlighted in green indicates that it is a correct letter in the correct position, while yellow indicates that it is a correct letter in the wrong position, and red indicates a wrong letter. At this point, you should use all the provided information, including the clue, guess, explanation, and guess feedback, to decide whether the given guess matches the clue, and also stick to guess feedback or not.

Please respond in lowercase letters and stick to this format:
agreement:yes or no
explanation:your reason for doing so

Please note that you must not guess any word based on the riddle clue and stick to the given format while responding.
